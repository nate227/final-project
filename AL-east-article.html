<h4>With the July 31 non-waiver Trade Deadline less than three weeks away, the buzz is building all around the Major Leagues. From cell phone to cell phone, from batting cage to batting cage, everyone is talking trades.

In the American League East, much of the hype surrounds Orioles superstar Manny Machado. Would Baltimore dare trade him within the division to the Yankees or Red Sox? There's also the matter of how New York will upgrade its starting rotation and if Boston can add another big arm to its bullpen.

This week, MLB.com spoke with scouts and executives for their opinions on what other teams might do.

Here is a breakdown.</h4>

<h4>BLUE JAYS</h4>
<h4>What they need to do: "If Josh Donaldson is healthy, they have to consider moving him. And they also have Ryan Tepera. He's currently on the DL, but his name is out there and he is a reliever a lot of teams could use. Donaldson could be a sneak attack for a team like Cleveland or the Yankees." -- National League scout</h4>

<h4>What they can get: "They are middle of the pack on offense and less than middle of the pack with pitching. They shouldn't be picky. They need young, controllable building blocks. Hard to believe they were contending for a title just two years ago. It has fallen apart fast. They need to get something done." -- American League coach</h4>

<h4>ORIOLES</h4>
<h4>What they will do: "You watch, they will try to get rid of [Brad] Brach, [Zach] Britton, Machado, Adam Jones, any or all of those guys. And the sleeper of the whole group is Mychal Givens, because he's the best one of the bunch. And he's controllable. He has a huge price tag." -- NL scout</h4>

<h4>What they can get: "I don't think they're going to get a lot back for Machado on his own. For a three-month rental, you're not going to give up your best prospect. But if you throw in Givens in a Machado deal? You'd get a ton back. Machado and Givens might get you Gleyber Torres. I don't think the Red Sox have enough in their system to get a guy like Givens. The Yankees do. The Yankees have an amazing system." -- NL scout</h4>

<h4>RAYS</h4>
<h4>What will they do: "Trade Wilson Ramos. They just need to agree with something with the Nationals. But don't sleep on the Red Sox now that Christian Vazquez is out for six to eight weeks. There is definitely potential for Ramos to Red Sox." -- AL scout</h4>

<h4>What they should do: "If I'm the Rays, I'm trading every one of the guys -- [Nathan] Eovaldi, [Adeiny] Hechavarria, Ramos. You're not going to win. You're out of it. The only guys I'm keeping in that bullpen are [Jose] Alvarado and [Diego] Castillo. And teams are looking for any little pieces. It's just the Rays are tough to deal with." -- AL front-office executive</h4>

<h4>RED SOX</h4>
<h4>What they need: "The Red Sox are only interested in getting a high-end eighth-inning reliever. And by high end, I mean Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis, somebody that's better than Joe Smith, but not as good as Craig Kimbrel. Those guys are former closers, period. By the way, I don't believe for a second they are going to trade for Machado. What message does that send to Devers, who is 21, and could wind up being a stud?" -- NL scout</h4>

<h4>What they can get: "I've heard the Red Sox are hot and heavy for Adam Ottavino, the big righty from the Rockies. Don't forget about Kyle Barraclough, either. Honestly, they need a lefty, which is why Zach Britton is probably the best fit. Dombrowski usually gets what he wants this time of year. The challenge this year is that he's already traded so many elite prospects the last few years." -- NL front-office executive</h4>

<h4>YANKEES</h4>
<h4>What they need: "They desperately need a starter. And if they can't get that, they're going to try and get someone to lengthen their bullpen by adding another piece to that already electric bullpen." -- NL scout</h4>

<h4>What they can get: "I would say the Yankees are in on J.A. Happ, [Nathan] Eovaldi, possibly Ryan Madson. If they can't get the starter they want, they have to have a five-man bullpen that can go out and the starters only have to go four. They'd go for the same ones as the Red Sox, save for Wade Davis, because the Yankees wouldn't take on that salary." -- NL scout</h4>

<h4>"They are the New York Yankees, so they should do what they can to get the best pitcher on the block -- Cole Hamels. You always love to have the lefty at Yankee Stadium." -- AL scout</h4>
